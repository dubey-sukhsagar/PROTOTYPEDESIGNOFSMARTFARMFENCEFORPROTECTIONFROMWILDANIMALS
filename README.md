# PROTOTYPE DESIGN OF SMART FARM FENCE FOR PROTECTION FROM WILD ANIMALS
The objectives of this project is to build an automated electric fence where the generation of shock and the alarm system are controlled by a micro-controller when an animal (or unauthorized person) tries to enter in field then a recorded voice is played, and high intensity light (only in night) is focused on the animal by locating his location in the field.
